# dental-project2
This project is for a turizm and the same time dental service website. It is a simple one without database connection and has a simple costum MVC structure build in it.
#challanges
the main challange was the make the webpage design, the front-end and the back-end from scratch. Everything except the PHPmailer serveice is build with custom coede with the perpouse to manage better and the that the website is lighter.
As I mentioned, to build everything from scratch was demanding and I had to be able to solve the errors in a limited time. An other challange was with the plannig, sometimes the clients requested major changes which led to the rebuilding of the project.
In additional the costum MVC structure resulted in manny errors which have to be fixed. In the end the site would be easy to manage since all the code is costume and practical to scale.
